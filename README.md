# Blank Ruby OO Template

## Instructions
* Run `bundle install`
* Create files for your models in the `lib` directory (ie define a `class Dog` inside of `lib/dog.rb`)
* Inside of `run.rb` you will be able to use your the classes defined in `lib`
* That's it. This is pretty bare-bones-- and that's the point.
